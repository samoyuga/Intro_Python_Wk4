**File Read & Write Program 📁✏️**
A Python program that reads a file, modifies its content, and writes it to a new file with comprehensive error handling.

**Features ✨**
File Reading: Safely reads content from any text file

Content Modification: Converts text to uppercase (customizable)

Error Handling: Comprehensive error management for various scenarios

User-Friendly: Clear prompts and error messages

Automatic Naming: Creates output files with "modified_" prefix

**Supported Error Handling 🛡️**
FileNotFoundError: When the specified file doesn't exist

PermissionError: When read permissions are denied

IsADirectoryError: When a directory is provided instead of a file

UnicodeDecodeError: When trying to read binary files

General exceptions for any other unexpected errors

**Installation & Requirements 🚀**
No additional dependencies required! This program works with standard Python 3.x libraries.

**Usage 📝**
Run the program:

bash
python file_modifier.py
Enter the filename when prompted:

text
Enter the filename to read: example.txt
The program will process the file and create a modified version:

text
Success! Modified file saved as 'modified_example.txt'
Customization 🔧
You can easily modify the transformation logic by editing this line in the code:

python
# Current modification: convert to uppercase
modified_content = content.upper()

# Other modification examples:
# modified_content = content.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
# modified_content = content.title()  # Title case
# modified_content = content.replace("old", "new")  # Replace text
Example 📋
Input file (example.txt):

text
Hello World!
This is a test file.
Welcome to file processing.
Output file (modified_example.txt):

text
HELLO WORLD!
THIS IS A TEST FILE.
WELCOME TO FILE PROCESSING.
**Error Examples ❌**
If errors occur, the program provides clear feedback:

text
Error: The file 'nonexistent.txt' does not exist.
text
Error: Permission denied to read 'protected_file.txt'.
